                Introduction<br />
            </div>
            Our recent <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-022-01835-2">study</a> has demonstrated how to capture, in JavaScript, computer screens' display change time with near-millisecond precision by taking into account the
            given monitors' refresh cycles (using <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame">RAF loops</a>). For the present follow-up study, we seek regular online response-time
            experiments whose primary goal is to assess common psychological
            phenomena (such as, e.g., a Stroop effect), so that we can assess extent of
            improvement in case of such real experimental results (e.g., a larger overall Stroop effect due to lower within-test variances). In each experiment we will implement and assess two different timing mechanisms: (a) the inferior
            conventional
            one that ignores the refresh cycle, and (b) the superior new one (with <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame">RAF</a>) that takes
            refresh cycles into account and hence provides superior (more precise) results. For each display
            change in each experiment, the underlying code will store both timings, and thereby the experiment leaders will be able to use the superior timing data for the primary purpose of the study (e.g., estimating the Stroop effect or its
            modulations under given conditions), and may simply disregard the other timing data. For
            our project however, the aim is solely the meta-analytical comparison of the two timing mechanisms. (In our eventual manuscript, the original purpose of each included study would only be briefly listed.)

            <div class="ttl">
                Design requirements for participation<br />
            </div>

            Any response-time experiment (requiring fast keypress responses, typically below one second) is suitable for us where there is a clear expectation for a substantial effect between the response times to any two stimulus types (e.g.,
            compatible and incompatible stimuli in the Stroop task – here we keep using the Stroop task as an archetypical behavioral response-time task example, but it could also be anything else). It does not matter whether this expected effect is
            the main effect of interest. For example, the experimenters may be interested in modulating
            the Stroop effect (which may or may not prove successful), but for us it is sufficient to have the Stroop effect itself, which then can be used for the comparison of the two timing mechanisms. (Note that we want to assess improvements in
            true effects, and therefore we cannot include studies that in the end find no significant effect between any of the response types.)

                Technical requirements for participation<br />
            </div>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Using your own custom JavaScript-based app for data collection.</b><br />
                    If you have your own web app for data collection, it should be easy to add to it the implementation of the new <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame">RAF</a> timing
                    measurements: both source code and intructions for it can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gasparl/dtjs">here</a> (but still we can help with it). For the "inferior" timing, the time should simply be called
                    outside (before or after) the RAF call, hence simply ignoring the refresh cycle. Both
                    timings should be saved for
                    each relevant display change. In the end, you should use the superior
                    timing measurement for the original purposes of your study, while on our end we will use the data from your experiment solely to compare the two timing mechanisms.

                <li>
                    <b>Using Labvanced</b><br />
                    If you are using Labvanced's online experiment creation framework, you have little else to do but to give permission for us to use the data collected via Labvanced. The Labvanced team, our collaboration partners in this project
                    (see LINK-TO-ADD), will implement the two different timing measurements for you (from which you can always use the superior one).
                </li>
            </ul>

            Note: If you have a JavaScript-based framework for online experiments and would like to join us (similarly to Labvanced), don't hesitate to contact us.

            <div class="ttl">
                The data and information we need<br />
            </div>
            At the end of the data collection for your experiment, we would ask for the following.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    All relevant data collected during the experiment. (If you prefer, you can exclude all data or information not related to display timing – see below for what is relevant.) Note: If you use Labvanced, it's enough to give permission
                    to use the data that's saved on Labvanced's server anyway.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A very short description of the chief effect, e.g.: "The RT difference between compatible and incompatible stimuli in a regular Stroop task."
                </li>
                <li>
                    The name of the relevant RT columns: (a) display time with RAF, (b) display time with no RAF, and (c) external (keyboard/mouse) response time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The name of the column that distinguishes the two stimulus types to be compared. For example: "stim_type" column name, with "compatible" and "incompatible" types.
                </li>
                We would also much welcome but do not strictly need, from each test: browser brand and version, OS brand and version, and the date (of starting and/or finishing the task).
            </ul>

            <div class="ttl">
                Our offer<br />
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If you contribute with a custom JavaScript app (which requires some effort on your part),
                    you are offered co-authorship in our eventual paper.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you contribute via Labvanced (which requires only very minimal effort on your part), we thank you under acknowledgements.
                </li>
            </ul>
            In either case, your study will be cited, and very briefly described (1-2 sentences) – and your contribution will be much appreciated.

            The project is organized by the iScience team at the University of Konstanz (team leader: Prof. Dr. Ulf-Dietrich Reips), in collaboration with the Department of Methodology and Statistics at Tilburg University (Dr. Bennett Kleinberg), as
            well as in the above-mentioned collaboration with Labvanced.
